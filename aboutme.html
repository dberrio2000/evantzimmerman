                    <p class = "aboutme-bio-text"> Born, raised, and based in Washington DC, Evan has always had a passion for singing and performing. Never one to miss a choir class in school,
                        Evan didn’t discover his true passion for performing until he was added to his martial art studio’s advanced demo performance team. In high school,
                        he decided to combine his two passions and found himself cast as Cogsworth in Beauty and the Beast, and the theater bug had bitten. In his junior year,
                        he began vocal studies with opera star Kerry Wilkerson, and in 2018 Evan attended his freshman year at George Mason University.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        During his time at Mason, Evan competed in various vocal competitions, such as the National Association of Teachers of Singing (NATS) competition,
                        and found work at the various local theatres where he would play roles ranging from the Emcee in Cabaret, to Ram Sweeney in Heathers. At the same time,
                        he also found himself performing in various functions, such as the Horatio Alger Association Awards Ceremony, and even dabbling in some minor voice acting engagements.
                        Evan Graduated from Mason in 2024 with his BFA in Musical Theater, and since then has been hitting the grind in an attempt to carve out his career.
